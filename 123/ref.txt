I am writing you to refer a friend of mine for the position of Internal Legal Advisor. In regard to this I want to share with you some details about him.
Actually I know him from his sister. We have enjoyed plenty of activities in a common party since we moved to Sofia and he turned out to be a nice person.
I am not aware of his professional experience and skills, but as a friend he possesses exceptional qualities like responsibility, politeness and loyalty. A trustworthy, open minded and educated person with whom you can find a common topic of conversation.

If I can be of further assistance I will be glad to help.
